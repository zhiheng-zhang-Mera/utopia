/**
 * UTOPIA · City · Project Foreman — autonomy authority.
 *
 * A long episode is supposed to keep going without a human pressing continue. The
 * plan states one rule about *who decides* that, and it is the reason this module
 * exists as a separate thing rather than a boolean threaded through:
 *
 *   runtime default  <  contract override  <  explicit run option
 *
 * The shipped default is `false`, so nothing continues on its own unless somebody
 * said so. A contract that says `autonomy_enabled: true` really does turn it on —
 * that is the bug this fixes: an autonomy controller created once at runtime
 * construction and never re-read can leave a contract's explicit request silently
 * ignored. The effective value is therefore computed *per run* from the three
 * sources, and the result reports which source won so the decision is auditable.
 *
 * Autonomy is bounded from three directions at once: continuation rounds, total
 * steps, and the stop conditions that no continuation may override. It is a
 * continuation flag, never a new planner: what it resumes with is the caller's own
 * remaining plan.
 *
 * Donor provenance: DS-Hns `app/engineering/autonomy.cjs` @
 * eeb57ca5c2c56bdf2e58c1216c610b4b9fbc973b, ported from CommonJS to ESM. This
 * donor module has **no `require` at all**, so the port is a mechanical
 * translation: every source label, budget default, stop reason and refusal string
 * is the donor's. The injected clock seam (`input.now`) is preserved.
