/**
 * UTOPIA · City · Project Foreman — workspace locking.
 *
 * An episode mutates a repository. Two episodes in the same workspace are two
 * writers over the same files, and the second one's plan is written against a tree
 * the first one is still changing — so the plan says exactly one active writer, and
 * this is how that is enforced rather than hoped for.
 *
 * The lock is a file, because the thing that must be excluded is another *process*:
 * a shell instance restarted after a crash must be able to find the previous
 * episode's lock, and an in-memory flag cannot do that. Three properties make it
 * safe to rely on:
 *
 *  1. **It identifies its owner.** The lock names the episode, the pid and when it
 *     was taken, so a stale lock can be reasoned about instead of merely found.
 *  2. **Staleness is explicit, never assumed.** A lock whose owning process is
 *     gone is *reported* as stale; reclaiming it is a decision the caller makes
 *     (`stealStale`), and the default refuses rather than taking it.
 *  3. **Release is verified.** Releasing checks that the lock is still the one this
 *     holder took, so a stolen lock is never deleted by the process that lost it.
 *
 * Nothing here learns anything: a lock is created for one episode and removed with
 * it.
 *
 * Donor provenance: DS-Hns `app/engineering/locking.cjs` @
 * eeb57ca5c2c56bdf2e58c1216c610b4b9fbc973b, ported from CommonJS to ESM. The
 * donor's seams — `root`, `dir`, `now`, `staleAfterMs`, `disabled` — are preserved
 * exactly; the pid liveness probe is the donor's own `process.kill(pid, 0)`.
