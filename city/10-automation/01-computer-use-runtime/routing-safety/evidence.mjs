/**
 * UTOPIA · Automation — verification evidence grading.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from the DS-Hns donor `app/computer-use/evidence.cjs` @
 * eeb57ca5c2c56bdf2e58c1216c610b4b9fbc973b.
 *
 * `verification.cjs` answers *what happened* (success / failure / unknown).
 * This module answers the second question a long-running executor has to ask:
 *
 *   is that answer strong enough to carry an action of THIS risk?
 *
 * Short tasks can get away with "something changed, assume it worked". A task
 * that runs for hours cannot: one false positive is multiplied by every step that
 * follows it, and the workspace ends up somewhere nobody intended. So evidence is
 * graded, and the grade has to clear the bar the action's own risk sets.
 *
 *   strong   a direct, specific, falsifiable observation of the intended effect
 *   medium   a specific observation of the target's own state or the navigation
 *   weak     "the world changed somewhere" — real evidence, but not of *this*
 *
 * The bar:
 *
 *   low        weak evidence is enough (a hover, a scroll, opening a menu)
 *   standard   medium evidence is required (a click that should change a control)
 *   high       strong evidence is required (saving, submitting, sending)
 *   critical   strong evidence *and* an explicit expected effect is required
 *              (delete, publish, install, purchase)
 *
 * "Critical demands an explicit expected effect" is deliberate: an action that
 * can destroy or publish something must say what success looks like before it
 * runs, otherwise nothing can distinguish success from a silent no-op.
 *
 * Nothing here is learned. The grade depends only on the action in front of it:
 * no profiles, no application learning.
 *
 * The donor imports `VERIFICATION_KINDS` / `DESTRUCTIVE_KINDS` from
 * `constants.cjs`; that sibling is being ported concurrently, so the values are
 * redeclared verbatim in `./contracts.mjs` instead.
