/**
 * UTOPIA · 10-automation / Computer Use Runtime — bounded tool reconnection.
 *
 * Long watch means tools break while nothing else does: CDP disconnects, a UIA
 * handle goes stale, a shell child crashes, a window disappears. The answer is
 * never "remember what the app used to look like and guess" — it is:
 *
 *   mark the channel degraded
 *     → attempt a *bounded* reconnect
 *     → re-observe the current state through the tool that just came back
 *     → continue only if the contract is still valid
 *
 * Two rules make that safe:
 *
 *  - The attempt budget belongs to the *step*, not to the channel. A channel that
 *    reconnects on its own schedule is a channel that can retry forever.
 *  - A stale target is never reused. Whatever was resolved before the failure is
 *    discarded, and the reconnect's whole job is to make a *fresh* observation
 *    possible.
 *
 * Ported from the DS-Hns donor `app/computer-use/reconnect.cjs` @
 * eeb57ca5c2c56bdf2e58c1216c610b4b9fbc973b.
 *
 * Local declaration, not import. The donor reads `CODES` / `ComputerUseError`
 * from `./errors.cjs` and `CAPABILITY_CONTROLLER` from `./constants.cjs`; both
 * siblings are being ported concurrently by another agent into other directories,
 * so they are declared in `./contracts.mjs`, verbatim (including
 * `TRANSPORT_LOST === CONTROLLER_UNAVAILABLE`).
 *
 * The file is carried whole, defects included, and one of them is behavioural
 * rather than cosmetic: a *successful* `recover()` still returns `world: null` —
 * the fresh observation the policy proved the channel with is used as the proof
 * and then dropped, exactly as in the donor.
 *
 * One deliberate adaptation, recorded in `DONOR.json`: the donor's default clock
 * and delay are `Date.now()` and `setTimeout`. This module is pure, so `now`
 * defaults to a deterministic step clock (0, 1, 2, … per read) and `sleep`
 * resolves without waiting; both remain injectable through `options`, unchanged.
