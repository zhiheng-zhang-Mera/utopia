/**
 * UTOPIA · 10-automation / Computer Use Runtime — transient stabilization.
 *
 * This module is the answer to the two failure modes every computer-use agent
 * hits: acting on a target that has already moved, and *concluding failure* before
 * the UI has had a chance to react.
 *
 * It is also the **only** place transient UI timing is decided: every caller asks
 * this module when it is safe to act and when it is safe to verify, instead of
 * inventing its own delay.
 *
 * The policy is fixed and deliberately boring:
 *
 *   short forced delay  +  long conditional wait
 *   minimum settle → check stability → revalidate → act
 *   act → bounded grace → observe events
 *
 * Nothing here is remembered between tasks: the ladders below depend only on the
 * *current* step's observations. No application-specific latency profile appears
 * in this file, and none ever will.
 *
 * Ported from the DS-Hns donor `app/computer-use/stabilization.cjs` @
 * eeb57ca5c2c56bdf2e58c1216c610b4b9fbc973b.
 *
 * Local declaration, not import, for the *constants only*. The donor reads
 * `TIMING` and `TARGET_MOVEMENT` from `./constants.cjs`, which is being ported
 * concurrently by another agent into another directory in this tree, so this file
 * declares them (see `./contracts.mjs`), verbatim. The third thing the donor
 * imports, `revalidate()` from `./target.cjs`, is **not** copied here: `target.cjs`
 * is owned by the sibling `target-guard` room, so it is imported from
 * `../target-guard/target.mjs` and re-exported from `./index.mjs`. Two copies of a
 * function that defines a verdict is exactly how one side silently stops agreeing
 * with the other.
 *
 * One deliberate adaptation, recorded in `DONOR.json`: the donor's default clock
 * is `{ now: () => Date.now(), sleep: (ms) => new Promise(setTimeout) }`. This
 * module is pure and must never read a real clock, so the default is a
 * deterministic *step clock* — `now()` starts at 0 and advances 1 ms per read, and
 * `sleep(ms)` resolves without waiting. The injection seam is unchanged
 * (`options.clock`), every wait still ends on the same condition and at the same
 * threshold, and a caller that needs real time injects a real clock.
 */
