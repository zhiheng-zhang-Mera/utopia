/**
 * UTOPIA · 10-automation / Computer Use Runtime — meaningful progress heartbeat.
 *
 * Donor: DS-Hns `app/computer-use/progress.cjs` @
 * eeb57ca5c2c56bdf2e58c1216c610b4b9fbc973b. Every acceptance rule, every refusal
 * reason string, the ring bound and the repeat window are the donor's, verbatim.
 *
 * A long-running executor has to answer one question continuously:
 *
 *   is this still working, or has it quietly stopped making progress?
 *
 * The trap is answering it with something that is always true. A timer ticking,
 * a log line being written, an action being *issued* — all of those happen even
 * when the task is stuck, so treating any of them as progress makes a stall
 * undetectable. This module therefore accepts only progress that is **evidence
 * that the world changed in a way the task cares about**:
 *
 *   verified-effect      a verification observed the intended effect
 *   subprocess-exit      an owned process finished (with its exit code)
 *   file-operation       a filesystem mutation was verified on disk
 *   state-transition     the run moved to a new state it had not reached
 *   criteria-satisfied   a success criterion became true
 *
 * and explicitly refuses:
 *
 *   a heartbeat that only ticks
 *   a repeated no-op (the same action, the same unchanged world)
 *   the runtime's own bookkeeping going round
 *
 * Nothing here is remembered across tasks (no application learning, no
 * business-level knowledge): the tracker is constructed per run and
 * discarded with the world state.
 *
 * PURITY ADAPTATION: the donor's `createProgressTracker` defaults `now` to
 * `() => Date.now()`. This port treats `now` as optional: with no clock injected
 * every recorded instant is `null` rather than the wall clock. The donor's own
 * `options.now` injection point is unchanged, so a caller that injects a clock
 * gets the donor's exact arithmetic.
